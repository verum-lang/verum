//! Typing context + framework-axiom attribution. Split per #198 V7.
//!
//! Two related types:
//!
//!   • [`FrameworkId`] — stable identifier for an external mathematical
//!     framework whose theorems Verum postulates as axioms. Every
//!     registered axiom carries one of these so `verum audit
//!     --framework-axioms` can enumerate the exact set of external
//!     results on which any given proof relies.
//!
//!   • [`Context`] — the typing context maintained during checking.
//!     Each binding maps a name to its declared type. The kernel never
//!     performs inference — it only checks.
